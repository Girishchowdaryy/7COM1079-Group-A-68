# Section 4 – Analysis (Refined)

## 4.1 Statistical Test Used
A Pearson correlation test was selected because GPA and weekly study hours are continuous variables; Pearson’s r estimates the strength and direction of any linear association. Complementary ordinary least-squares regression (GPA ~ studyweek) was used to estimate the slope and the share of variance explained (R²), and to produce diagnostic plots for linearity, homoscedasticity and residual normality. This combination addresses both hypothesis testing and effect-size estimation. (≈75 words)

## 4.2 Hypothesis Test Decision and Interpretation
The Pearson correlation was r = 0.04160 (p = 0.762967), indicating a negligible and statistically non-significant association. Regression estimated a slope of 0.001127 (p = 0.76297), with R² = 0.0017, so study hours explain ≈0.17% of GPA variance. Based on p > 0.05 we fail to reject H0 (no linear correlation). Practically, more study hours alone do not predict higher GPA in this sample; attention to study quality and other factors is warranted. (≈100 words)
