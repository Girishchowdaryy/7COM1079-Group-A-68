# Draft — Introduction

## 1.1 Problem statement and research motivation
Academic performance, often measured through GPA, is widely assumed to improve as students increase their study time. However, research shows inconsistent findings, with some studies showing weak or no relationship when other factors such as sleep, stress, and study quality are considered (Nonis & Hudson, 2010). Understanding whether study hours meaningfully relate to GPA helps inform how students allocate time and whether academic support should focus on study duration or alternative factors.

## 1.2 The data set
The dataset contains 55 student observations with variables: gpa, studyweek (study hours per week), sleepnight (sleep duration), out (social outings), and gender. Data were self-reported for the module project. Observations with missing values in gpa or studyweek were removed.

## 1.3 Research question
Is there a statistically significant linear relationship between students’ weekly study hours and their GPA?

## 1.4 Null and alternative hypotheses (H0 / H1)
H0: There is no linear correlation between study hours per week and GPA in the population (Pearson r = 0).  
H1: There is a linear correlation between study hours per week and GPA in the population (Pearson r ≠ 0).  
A two-tailed test is used due to mixed prior evidence and to avoid assuming a positive direction in advance.
