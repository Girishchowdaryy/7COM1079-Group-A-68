# Section 3 – Visualisation Draft (Completed)

## 3.1 Main Plot – Scatterplot (Study Hours vs GPA)
The scatterplot visualises the relationship between weekly study hours and GPA. A linear regression line is added to show the direction and strength of any trend. The plot allows us to see overall dispersion, clustering, and whether study hours appear to predict GPA. In this dataset, the points form a wide cloud, indicating a weak linear pattern.

## 3.2 Additional Plots – Histograms and Diagnostics
Histograms of study hours and GPA show how each variable is distributed. Study hours are spread widely, while GPA values cluster more tightly. The residuals-vs-fitted plot and QQ-plot help assess linearity, constant variance, and normality. These diagnostics confirm that the relationship is weak and the regression model has limited explanatory power.

## 3.3 Key Observations Summary
The scatterplot shows no strong upward or downward trend, and the regression line is nearly flat. Both histograms reveal reasonable distributions but no pattern linking high study hours to higher GPA. Diagnostic plots show residuals scattered around zero without structure. Overall, visual evidence suggests only a minimal relationship between study hours and GPA.
