\# Section 3 – Visualisation



\## 3.1 Main Plot – Scatterplot (Study Hours vs GPA)

The scatterplot compares weekly study hours with GPA and includes a linear regression line to show the overall trend. This plot is appropriate because both variables are continuous and the research question focuses on correlation. The visual shows widely scattered points with no strong directional pattern. The regression line appears almost flat, indicating a weak linear relationship between study hours and GPA.

\## 3.2 Additional Plots – Histograms and Diagnostics

The histograms show the distribution of study hours and GPA separately. Study hours vary widely across students, while GPA values are more concentrated. The residuals-vs-fitted plot shows no clear pattern, suggesting that the model does not capture a meaningful relationship. The QQ-plot indicates roughly normal residuals, meaning model assumptions are not severely violated despite the weak relationship.

\## 3.3 Key Observations Summary

Across all visualisations, there is no clear evidence that higher study hours lead to higher GPA. The scatterplot shows a loose cloud of points with almost no slope. Histograms reveal distributions that do not suggest a strong underlying link. Diagnostic plots confirm that the regression model fits poorly, reinforcing that study hours alone do not explain GPA variation.
