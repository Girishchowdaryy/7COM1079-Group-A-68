# \## 2.1 Research Papers

# Nonis and Hudson (2010) examined how study time and strategy quality predict academic outcomes. They found that time alone is a weak predictor unless combined with structured learning behaviour. Credé and Phillips (2011) conducted a meta-analysis showing that study habits and motivation consistently outperform raw study hours in predicting GPA. Plant et al. (2005) argued that deliberate practice—high-quality focused study—produces better academic performance even when total hours are similar. Together, prior research highlights a small, inconsistent link between study hours and GPA.

# \## 2.2 Research Gap and Interest

# Students often assume more study hours always equal higher GPA, but research shows the relationship is weak and inconsistent. Most studies focus on large, diverse samples; far fewer examine smaller dataset contexts like ours. Evaluating whether the expected positive trend appears in real student-reported data helps identify whether hours alone matter or if other factors dominate. This gap justifies our research question and encourages future work exploring study strategies instead of raw time.
