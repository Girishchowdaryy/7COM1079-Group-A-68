\# Section 5 – Evaluation



\## 5.1 What Went Well (75 words)

The group achieved strong technical progress early in the project. Repository structure, analysis scripts and visualisation outputs were created quickly and consistently. Communication through Git kept the workflow clear and prevented duplicated effort. The statistical analysis and plotting were completed efficiently, and the dataset posed no major cleaning issues. The group followed the planned timeline, allowing each section to be written with minimal delays and smooth integration into the final report.



\## 5.2 Points for Improvement (75 words)

The main challenge was uneven distribution of work and varying levels of engagement. Some members contributed less consistently and required guidance to complete basic tasks. Earlier agreement on roles would have reduced uncertainty. Future projects should include weekly check-ins and clearer expectations for individual deliverables. Encouraging each member to write and commit independently would improve writing quality and reduce reliance on single contributors.



\## 5.3 Group’s Time Management (50 words)

Time management improved significantly after the first week. A structured plan allowed earlier completion of analysis and visualisation tasks, giving more time for drafting and refinement. More frequent short meetings could have prevented delays caused by unclear responsibilities, but overall the group met interim deadlines effectively.



\## 5.4 Project’s Overall Judgement (50 words)

The project was successful in delivering clear analysis, reproducible code and a well-structured report. Despite uneven contributions, the final output meets academic standards and demonstrates understanding of statistical testing, visualisation and reporting. The dataset was handled correctly, and the conclusions are supported by evidence.



\## 5.5 Comment on GitHub Log Output (50 words)

GitHub logs show consistent progress across the project timeline, with major commits related to analysis, visualisation and documentation. Key commits include repository setup, analysis script development and incorporation of figures. Appendix B provides screenshots demonstrating commit history, collaborator access and contribution distribution.



\# Section 6 – Conclusions



\## 6.1 Results Explained (75 words)

The results indicate no meaningful linear relationship between study hours per week and GPA. The Pearson correlation coefficient was near zero and statistically non-significant, and regression analysis produced a very small slope with minimal explanatory power. Visual inspection of scatterplots and diagnostics further confirmed that increases in study time do not translate into measurable improvements in GPA within this dataset.



\## 6.2 Interpretation of the Results (75 words)

The findings suggest that raw study hours alone are not a reliable indicator of academic performance. This aligns with literature showing that study quality, motivation and learning strategies play greater roles than time spent. In practical terms, students who simply increase hours without improving study methods are unlikely to see major GPA gains.



\## 6.3 Limitations and Future Work (50 words)

The dataset is small and lacks measures of study quality, which limits the explanatory power of statistical tests. Future research should incorporate behavioural and psychological variables to build richer predictive models. Larger samples may reveal more stable correlations and allow comparison across demographic groups or academic disciplines.
