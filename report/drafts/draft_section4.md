# Section 4 – Analysis Draft (Completed)

## 4.1 Statistical Test Used
A Pearson correlation test was selected because both GPA and study hours per week are continuous numerical variables and the research question focuses on the strength and direction of a linear association. To complement this, a simple linear regression model (GPA ~ studyweek) was applied to estimate slope, quantify effect size, and check assumptions through residual diagnostics. This combination provides clear evidence on whether weekly study time predicts GPA and whether any observed trend is statistically meaningful. (≈75 words)

## 4.2 Hypothesis Test Decision and Interpretation
The Pearson correlation produced r = 0.04160 with p = 0.762967, indicating no statistically significant linear relationship between study hours and GPA. The linear regression slope was 0.001127 (p = 0.76297), showing that increases in study hours predict virtually no increase in GPA. With an R² of only 0.0017, study hours explain less than 1% of GPA variation. Therefore, the null hypothesis (no correlation) is not rejected. The results suggest that in this dataset, simply studying more hours does not meaningfully predict higher academic performance. (≈100 words)
